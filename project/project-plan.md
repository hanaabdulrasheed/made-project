# Project Plan

## Title
Obesity Patterns in the U.S.: Analyzing Socio-Economic Factors and Health Trends

## Main Question
What socio-economic factors influence obesity rates across different states in the United States, and how do they interact?

## Description
Obesity is a significant public health issue that has been linked to various chronic diseases, including diabetes and heart disease. New CDC population data from 2023 show that in 23 states more than one in three adults (35%) has obesity. This project analyzes trends in obesity rates across different U.S. states, examining how socio-economic factors such as income levels and education correlate with these trends. By utilizing data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the U.S. Census Bureau, this analysis aims to provide insights into the factors contributing to obesity and highlight areas for potential public health interventions.
